This problem must consist of at least two key questions of interest and your description of the problem and questions should be easily understood by a casual reader. Citations to motivating sources are preferred where possible (e.g. news articles, published papers, etc. Do not use Wikipedia itself, but the links Wikipedia articles cite may be useful)\n",

    "   * Data must include at least **2 numeric** (e.g. number of friends, height, gpa, temperature, etc.) and **1 categorical** (e.g. color, class, car type, etc.) features and have at least **30 unique observations** (in other words, the final data set must be at least 30 rows and have at least 3 columns)\n",

    "     * An exception might be made if there are multiple files/tables from disparate sources which will be non-trivial to clean/combine, but you *must* discuss this with the professor.\n",

    "4. (1\\%) Write a paragraph about how the data will be used to solve the problem and your two questions of interest. At this point of the semester, we haven't studied the machine learning methods yet, but you should have a general idea of what you can do with ML (predict numerical values, predict class labels, or characterize relationships between features). If you do not, ask a TA or the professor or do a little googling."
