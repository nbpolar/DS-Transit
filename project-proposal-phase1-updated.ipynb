    "I plan to use the TransitLand API to predict information about public transportation in major cities. After college, or as newly-workers, many young adults look for full-time jobs and often need to move to a new city during this phase of their life. They often choose their city, and one thing they may consider to be very important is a fitting system of public transporation that they may use to commute to work. I wanted to develop a model that will predict or provide information about the efficiency of transportations in different major cities that young adults may move to. The TransitLand API is very easy to use, and I will use this data, which include modes of transportation, different routes each city offers, as well as the efficiency measured through route sort order, to categorize a city as transit-rich or transit-limited!"

    "Questions of interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which major city offers the most accessible and efficient public transit system for recent college graduates or young adults?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How does the variety of transportation (bus, subway, etc) vary across these major cities?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My main concern with this data is that the route_type in this dataset returns numerical values, which is something I wanted, but it is not as human readable. However, this could potentially be a positive trait and easy for someone to look for and sort through one mode of transportation, for example, by typing \"0\" instead of \"railroad.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, route_id_numeric could be cleaned to display the number of routes per city instead, which may be a bit more helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I have every necessary feature to address a categorical prediction for each city as transit-rich or transit-limited, a useful categorization for those moving to a new city. I plan to predict numeric results like route priority through regression or predict categorical \"transit-rich\" or \"transit-limited\" through classification.\n"
